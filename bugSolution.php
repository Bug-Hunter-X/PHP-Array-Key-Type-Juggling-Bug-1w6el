Several approaches can mitigate the array key type juggling problem:

1. **Strict Type Handling:**  Using strict type checking (declare(strict_types=1);) at the beginning of the script can prevent implicit type conversions and reveal the issue at compile time.  However, this may not always be feasible or desirable in large projects. 

2. **Consistent Key Types:**  Adopt a consistent convention for your array keys.  Either consistently use string keys or consistently use integer keys. This avoids ambiguity.  

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "apple"; // Consistent string keys
$myArray["2"] = "banana";

// OR

$myArray = [];
$myArray[1] = "apple"; // Consistent integer keys
$myArray[2] = "banana";
```

3. **Type Casting:** Explicitly cast keys to a specific type to enforce consistency:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray[(string)1] = "apple"; // Ensures string keys
$myArray[(int) "1"] = "banana"; // Ensures integer keys
```

Choosing the right approach depends on your code's context and the level of strictness you prefer.  The consistent key types approach is often the easiest and most effective way to prevent this type of error.
